The purpose of this exercise was to familiarize us with the tools and capabilities of the Godot program. What I've created here is a rudimentary version of the game "Brick Breaker". Through the creation of this game, I have learned what nodes are and how the structure of Nodes and child nodes create the foundation of a game; as well as adding on to my previous knowledge of how physics works and behaves in a 2D environment.
